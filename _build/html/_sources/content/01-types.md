## **Types of Machine Learning**

Machine Learning can be divided into four main types based on the nature of the data and the way the system learns from it. These are:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-Supervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning

Each type follows a different learning approach.

### **Supervised Learning**

```markdown
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.
```It involves developing algorithms and models that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions automatically.
