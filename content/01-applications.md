### **Applications**

Machine Learning has become a part of many areas of daily life and business operations. It helps computers make decisions, recognize patterns, and predict outcomes based on data. The applications of Machine Learning can be seen in travel, marketing, healthcare, social media, sales, automation, and financial services.

#### **1. Travel**

Machine Learning plays a major role in improving travel experience and operations. Airlines use Machine Learning to optimize flight routes, reduce fuel usage, and predict flight delays. It also helps in managing ticket pricing based on demand. Airlines and hotel booking sites use Machine Learning models to analyze booking trends and competitor pricing. Cab services such as Uber and Ola use Machine Learning for surge pricing. When the number of customers is more than available vehicles, the system increases fares automatically to balance demand and supply. Google Maps uses Machine Learning to provide live traffic updates.
It collects data from users’ mobile devices and predicts the best routes by analyzing speed, location, and road conditions.

#### **2. Marketing**

Machine Learning helps businesses understand customer behaviour and personalize their marketing strategies. E-commerce websites such as Amazon and Flipkart use Machine Learning to recommend products based on past purchases, browsing history, and similar user preferences. Machine Learning models help in predicting which customers are likely to stop using a service or switch to another brand. Companies use this information to provide special offers or improve customer support.

#### **3. Healthcare**

Machine Learning plays an important role in diagnosis and  treatment. Smartwatches and fitness bands use Machine Learning to track heart rate, sleep quality, and activity levels. They can alert users or doctors in case of abnormal readings. ML algorithms are trained on thousands of medical images to detect diseases such as pneumonia, fractures etc. Image classification and segmentation help in identifying affected areas in MRI or CT scans.

#### **4. Social Media**

Machine Learning helps social media platforms personalize content, detect trends, and ensure user safety. Platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn use Machine Learning to suggest new friends. ML algorithms analyze posts, comments, and reviews to understand public opinion.

#### **5. Sales**

Machine Learning is used to increase sales and improve customer management. By studying purchase history and engagement data, ML helps companies find customers who bring the most profit. ML models can predict which products will sell more in the future based on demand trends. Machine Learning can suggest the right discount to offer to attract buyers without reducing profit too much.

#### **6. Automation**

Automation uses Machine Learning to perform tasks without human control. Autonomous vehicles use cameras, sensors, and ML models to understand road conditions, detect obstacles, and make driving decisions safely. Tesla’s Autopilot system is an example. Drones use Machine Learning for navigation, object detection, and surveillance.

#### **7. Credit and Insurance**

Machine Learning improves financial decision-making and fraud prevention. Banks and insurance companies use ML algorithms to detect unusual activities such as fake claims or suspicious transactions. Insurance companies use Machine Learning to estimate the likelihood of a claim being made by a customer. This helps in deciding premium amounts and reducing financial risk.
